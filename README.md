<h3>ERC20, stake tokens &amp; integration with responsive react / MUI build</h3>

<p>Hey! Thanks for checking out my staking protocol project. This project allows a user to connect through the Kovan testnet, reveal their balances of Weth, Dai &amp;&nbsp;<em>Dapp(Fau Token) </em>and stake their funds<em>. </em>The user must approve and confirm the transaction (2x step process) to stake their tokens.<em>&nbsp;</em>I&#39;ve also built a basic react interface using a mixture of MUI and&nbsp;<a href="https://usedapp.io/">https://usedapp.io/</a>&nbsp;for the Metamask functionality.</p>

<p>If you&#39;d like to preview how this protocol works, feel free to clone the repository, launch a localhost server using <strong>npm start&nbsp;</strong>and ensure you have a metamask wallet connected through the kovan network. You will also need to add a .env file to your project with your private keys.  I&#39;ve also included a function to&nbsp;<em>unstake&nbsp;</em>tokens. However, for simplicity sake this can simply be called from a terminal instead of building out the react components.</p>
